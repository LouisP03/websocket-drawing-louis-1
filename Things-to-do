Create array and functionality involving canvasData containing data for canvas.
Send this data to each new connection, perhaps on connection or on request (button click).
Establish procedure for drawing contents of canvasData to screen.

This could all be done server-side on server.js (?):
     - when server.js running, push all data that is transmitted through the server to canvasData as an individual array
     - socket.emit('requestCanvasData') after socket = io.connect()
     - server.js detects this event, sends across canvasData
     - when sketch.js receives this data, goes through canvasData and draws to screen using same logic (?) to draw everything else
     - next thing to do: work on code below line 56 on sketch.js
